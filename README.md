All The News That's Fit to Scrape

I've created an app that accomplishes the following:
Whenever a user visits my website, the app scrapes stories from a news outlet called goodnews.com and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to my application database. The app scrapes and displays this information about the article:

Headline - the title of the article
Summary - a short summary of the article
URL - the url to the original article

Users can leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users can delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
